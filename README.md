It merges the capabilities of 3D software and it has MTR creator features that allow a user to create models faster and more efficiently!
This will be the first screen in Minecraft to have Advanced Model Part Editing in Minecraft History!

It allows Java Model Files exported from Blockbench to be imported. 
All Locations Save file has locations where a user can import all model locations onto the viewer and can save onto a folder in Minecraft. When Minecraft is restarted, it imports the same locations of the user's All Locations Save file!
Render Model Generation Mode (Profile Gen) allows Java Train Models files to be imported by allowing a user to set the train render configuration and import.

This big feature will have lifetime updates and wonâ€™t stop updating like what happened to Tabula - 3D Modeler!

I plan on releasing it in January next year (estimate). It will be released on Modrinth. Also on Curseforge depending on the situation on their website. It will be released in Beta version however I might give early access to Alpha Versions depending on the progress of the feature.
